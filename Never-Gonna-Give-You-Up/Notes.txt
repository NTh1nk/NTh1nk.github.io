            So im going to start by addresing the elephant in the room, what is rick rolling, and how it started.
            It originated from duckrolling, a practice common on the site called "4Chan" in the early 2000, this practice included sending a link saying that it was something great/new, for example a new video game, and then when the person clicked the link, it would be a picture of a duck instead.
            This since evolved to "RickRolling". Just picture this: GTA 4 is releasing any moment now, so everyone floods to the GTA website(Rocktstar), to watch the trailer, but its DOWN, so what do you do.   </font>
